# **Shogun** 
When a mysterious European ship is found marooned in a nearby fishing village, Lord Yoshii Toranaga discovers secrets that could tip the scales of power and devastate his enemies.
- John Blacktorn
Blackthorne joins a Dutch privateer mission to search for "the Japans," intending to break the economic monopoly the Portuguese and Spanish have over New World imports into Europe, and by extension the spiritual influence of the Catholic Church. They begin with five ships, John being assigned to the Erasmus, and are armed in order to plunder any Spanish territory they find. During this, they steal a Spanish rutter detailing a route through Magellanâ€™s Pass in Chile, enabling them to enter the Pacific.
